# v0.1.0 created on Jan. 15, 2017
#  (1) move "powerMediation" from Depends to Imports
#  (2) add functions 'minMAFeQTL.ANOVA' and 'minMAFeQTL.SLR'
# v0.0.9 created on Jan. 13, 2017
#  (1) revised 'minEffectEQTL.ANOVA'
#
# v0.0.8 created on Dec. 31, 2016
#  (1) edited online helps
#
# v0.0.7 created on Dec. 30, 2016
#  (1) added author "Scott T. Weiss"
#  (2) edited online helps
#
# v0.0.6 created on Dec. 27, 2016
#  (1) add intermediate output to 'minEffectEQTL.ANOVA'
#  (2) edited online menu for 'minEffectEQTL.ANOVA'
#
# v0.0.5 created on Dec. 26, 2016
#  (1) change depends to R (>= 3.3.0)
#  (2) change the author order
#
# v0.0.4 created on Dec. 12, 2016
#  (1) added functions 'powerEQTL.ANOVA2' and 'ssEQTL.ANOVA2'

# v0.0.3 created on Dec. 12, 2016
#  (1) fixed a bug in powerEQTL.ANOVA.R: 
#  gm1 = deltaVec[1]
#  should be
#  gm1 = -deltaVec[1]
#
#  (2) fixed a bug in minEffectEQTL.ANOVA: need to directly use simplified power calculation formula. So add function 'powerEQTL.ANOVA'
#
# v0.0.2 created on Dec. 11, 2016
#  (1) relax the assumption in ANOVA approach: mu2-mu1 can be different from mu3-mu2
#  (2) add function minEffectEQTL.ANOVA to calculate minimum detectable effect size
#      delta/sigma. This would be helpful in design stage where we have no prior
#      info about delta and sigma. delta=mu2-mu1=mu3-mu2.
